<h1>LESSON 1.</h1>


About the primitive , a single stroke.

一 represents the unity, principle of numeration;

It figures the primordial unity, source
of all beings; 

— It
is the 1st radical in K'ang-hsi's dictionary.

In composition, says the Shuo-wen, — is most commonly symbolic;

Its different symbolic meanings may be summed up under four
principal categories.

Firstly, when written on top of the compound, — represents either heaven, or
a roof, or any cover. Example:

B

雨 Yu3 The rain. Drops of water falling from a cloud that hangs to — heaven; J means the vertical falling;

一 
It is the 173th radical in K'ang-hsi.





C 

天 
T'ien1. Heaven, the vast — extent of space that is above 
大
men, the highest of things;

Note that (L. 60)

means watt and not great; therefore do not translate
the unique great. The derived idea, as explai-
ned by all the commentators, is that of physical or
moral superiority. The Ch'un-ch'iu says:

Placed above them, heaven go-
verns men... According to this fundamental notion,
any superior, says the Erh-ya, is the of his
inferior;

— For the
compounds of , see Lesson CO C.



D
末
mò
Mo4. The outmost twigs, the — top of a tree;

— Phonetic
series 138.



Secondly, placed below the compound, — represents the foundation, the
base, or any support. Examples:

旦
dàn
Tan*. The dawn, the beginning of the day. The
sun above a line, viz. the horizon;

— Phonetic series 162.

立
lì
Li4. To stand, to be erected. A man (L. 60) standing upon the ground. This character is the reverse of , above C.

It forms the 117th radical in
K'ang-hsi. Phonetic series 134.


本
běn
Pen3. The trunk of a tree. The part of a tree
above the — earth. This character is the reverse of
, above D
— Phonetic series 147.

Thirdly, — represents a barrier, a hindrance. Examples:

閂
shuān
Shuan1 A beam — used to holt a door.


丂
qiǎo
Ch'iao3. Difficulty in breathing, oppression;

The line bent up represents the breah that tries to go out, but is checked by the transversal barrier.
See L. 58. — Phonetic series 3.

Fourthly, — represents something contained. Example:

血
xiě
Hueh3. Blood. A vase containing — something.
This character primitively meant the oblation of the
blood of the victim in the sacrifices;

See the Legge's edi-
tion, Part II, Bk VI, Ode VI, 5,

The modern signification, blood, is a
derivative, chuan-chu. See Lesson 157. — It forms the
143th radical in K'ang-hsi. — Phonetic series 208.

<h1>LESSON 2.</h1>

About the character 二, two strokes, and some of its derivatives

二
èr
Erh4. Two. The number of the earth, because it
makes the pair with heaven. The number of the two principles yin and yang.

— It is the 7th radical in K'ang-hsi.

In composition, has three different uses.

Firstly, means two. Example:

仁
rén
Jen2. The fundamental virtue of Confucianism, which the Shuo-wen defines:

, to love each other. The benevolence
that must link each 人 亻rén man with 二 his neighbour;

two, mutual, reciprocal. From 仁 is derived

佞

Secondly, represents two terms, two extremes. Examples:

D

earth, to gain his point;

— Phonetic series 325.

E

亙
gèn gèng
Ken4 or Keng4. Idea of passage, of crossing, of
duration, between two terms. Ilrepresents apassage-
boat, that crosses from one bank to the other:

See L. 66. — In the modern writing, 亘
(L. 76 H) is often used for . II is a mistake. Note
the compound

F
恆
Heng. Constancy, perseverance. The heart (the
will) crossing from the beginning till the end, as a
boat does from one bank to the other; the moral trip
continued till one reaches the harbour. Rather a well
found simile.



G Thirdly. is an old form of shang4, high; and — reversal, an old
form of hsia4, low. See L. 5. —This remark is to be remembered; there will he
many applications of it. See, for instance, L. 3 D, L. 29 H, etc... is
sometimes reduced to a single stroke, as in L. 43 N, L. 50 0, etc.

<h1>LESSON 3.</h1>

About 三, three strokes, and its derivatives.

三

San1. Three; The number of
heaven earth and humanity; the san1 is'ai2,
three Powers. Hence

王

Wang2. King.

According

to the ancients, the king is the one, the man

Phonetic series 724.

straightened , forms a part of

D
示
shì
Shih4. Influx coming from heaven; auspicious or
inauspicious signs, by which the will of heaven is known to mankind;

The two horizontal lines are the old form
of the character shang1, high, superior (L. 2G);
here they mean heaven; The three
vertical lines represent what is hanging from heaven, viz. the sun, the moon and the stars, the mutations of which reveal to men the transcendent things;

The actual meaning, to teach, is chuanchu. forms the 113th radical of characters relating to transcendental matters. Note its modern contracted form, that is easily mistaken for the
contracted form ofgarments (L. 16 A).



祘
 
示 doubled forms 祘 suàn hsuan4 hsüan 4， calculate. It is believed that this
character figures the. primitive abacus, and has nothing to do with See and L. 47 G, F. Any-
how from is derived the phonetic compound
蒜 suàn hsuan4, garlic.

<h1>LESSON 4.</h1>

About the dot.

丶
zhǔ
Chu5. A dot, a sign of punctuation, etc. Formerly
the dot was round; it is now piriform, on account of
the. writing-brush that writes thus. It is the 3d radical in K'ang-hsi.

主
zhǔ
Chu3 The inferior part represents a lamp, the. flame
of which is One writes
now to mean a lamp, the character signifying

rises above the multitude and is seen by all, as the flame rises and shines over the lamp. — Phonetic
series 115.

丹 
dān
Tan1. Cinnabar. The 丶 is supposed to represent the red mineral, and 井 the mine where it is found;

The ancient characters suggest

a different interpretation. They represent the crucible of the Taoist alchimists, with cinnabar in it Decompose and recompose cinnabar, was their chief practice. See L 115 D. — Phonetic Series 83. Compare,
(L.14T.) —Two old characters express the (L.30 D)
transformation of mortal men into immortal genii,
by means of alchemy and divination (L. 56 A.)

D N.B. —In the modern writing, many characters, for instance , are
surmounted with a dot, that replaces elements which are very different in the an-
cient writing. It is the same with the dot introduced inside some of the charac-
ters, for example The writing-brush is the cause of it. — Note by the
way that the 8th radical, is but a corruption of the 11th tb radical.

<h1>LESSON 5.</h1>


We saw (L. 1, 1° and 2°) — used as meaning an horizontal line. From this accep-
tionare derived the following characters;

上
shàng
Shang4. Up, upon, superior, to mount. A sign
placed above, the fundamental line , signifying
above the level;

The ancient form of this character was
(L. 2 G), the smaller top line being usep as a sign
relatively to the longer bottom line. In the more
recent forms, the sign became more and more intricate. — In the modern wri-
ting, kept up its ancient form at the top of many characters, for example,

modern forms,

Third series : 𠃊 combined with 十 ten (L.-24), and 目 eye (L. 158), gives

Fei^1 . To fly. A primitive. It represents a crane (very
common in China) seen from behind. Upwards, the
head and the neck bent up, as when the cranes arc
flying. Below, the tail. On both sides, the wings

being granted, one may now explain

B

卂

Second series: 丮 Chi*. Is derived from the primitive

D ⺄ Chi*. To catch. This primitive is found only in one
compound, with the hand 手(L i8), which gives

E 丮 Chi*. To do, to hold. It represents the hand doing or
keeping something; forms
important compounds in which it is nearly always
wrongly shaped. The scribes write(as above B), or

First series: chuan^3 .

A 𡿨 ㄑ Chuan^3 . Small water course, rivulet;

 𡿨 primitive. Forms some important compounds,
as:

B 水 Shui^3 氵. Water, small river; The four strokes
added to the rivulet represent the waves of the water.
See L. 125. — It is the 85lh radical in K'ang-hsi.

C 攸 Yu^1 yōu. Primitive meaning, to sound a ford. A man亻

粼 Lin^2 . A torrent (L. 126 D).
兪 Yu^2 . A boat ( /L. 14/ F).

Note that engravers substitute for the巜 character 刂, easier to be engraved.
But 刂being also an abbreviation for 刀, the 18th radical, this double employ of
the same sign brings confusion.

Third series: 巛 ch'uan^1 . It is repeated thrice.

E 巛 川  Ch'uan^1 . A river, a big stream formed by the junc-
tion of several others;

Note the differences in the modern writing. — It is the

C 舍 She^1 . A shed, a booth;

inverted, as stated above K. This interpretation was
made by Li-ssu. — The old character was composed of
four nuggets, of horizontal lines denoting the stratifi-
cation of the metalliferous layer, and lastly of a cover
which meant that the whole was conceited under
the earth. Evidently a primitive. — It

of many characters relating to meat and food. Note
the derivative

俎 Tsu^3 zǔ. Credence-table charged with meat, that was
offered in the sacrifices;

About the two seriesand

First series;

乃Nai^3 nǎi . A primitive. A difficulty of breathing; any
difficulty in general; It is intended
to represent the air curling to make its way through
the wind-pipe. A sigh, a cry. This character, or rather

conjunctions being not /meaning /characters, but /exclamations /to make the
hearer understand, how that which one is to say, is connected with that
which
one has just said — Phonetic series 7. In reality, does not form a series.
Among the derivatives ascribed to it, i Those in nai are arbitrary
abbreviations

analogous to that of (See L. 41 D, and L. 10 A). Nowandbeing
both read nai, are used one for another, and is the graphic radical of a

To this charactercombined withchih^3 (L. 31 B), is ascribed the compound

夃*Ying*^*2* *.** *Note the fusion of the from ,with the

盈*Ying*^*2* *. *The

abundance that comes to one when, by one's efforts,

onearrived to fill with provisions one's vessels.

The etymologists give also as a derivative of

孕Yun^4 . To be with child, , This derivation
is a fancy one, as the commentators admit. In this
character, 乃 is a primitive, that represents the
closing in of the (L, 94 A) foetus by the womb.

cal form of the character seems to denote a more, natural explanation: the

風*Feng*^*1* fēng*. *The wind; For, says the
Glose, when the wind blows, insects are born;

This composition and interpretation are in the
manner of Li-ssu. —The ancient character was derived
from sun, motion (L. 7 A), extension,
expansion. All this seems to mean that the atmos-
pheric currents are produced by the action of solar
rays; which is true for some winds. — It is the 182th

This character has nothing in common with (L. 35),
under which it was erroneously classified by K'ang-
hsi. It must be carefully distinguished . from fu^4
(35 B), and from fei^4 (L. 79 G ). There are a few
insignificant compounds. Note the logical aggregate
nao^4 , to bustle; (L. 11 I) to quarrel as in the
market place ; the noisy wrangling and confusion
of a market, so dear to the Chinese.

characters, e.g. L. 126 F; L. 154 B; L. 72 D; L. 39 1. But the
following are derived from (L. 54), and not from , as the modern form
might induce one to believe, e.g. L. 69 G; L. 167 C; etc.

from chung^3 , L. 69 G

Mao^4 A covering for the head; that whichcovers

the head (L. 1, 4^0 );

It is now written —The scribes write	;

so that the derivatives of mao^4 cannot be distinguished from those ofyueh^1
(L. 73 A). Still improving on the scribes, K'ang-hsi, after having
classified, under
the 14th radical , characters that do not belong to it, placed the true
derivati-
ves of, the whole series .under the 13th radical . Such is the value
of classifications based upon the modern characters, altered or mingled with

pean handkerchief, that was worn in ancient times,
hanging from the girdle, and used for cleaning and

dusting. By extension, a bonnet, the ancient Chinese putting on a cloth
to cover

their heads; cloth in general, represents the two extremities of cloth
hanging

from the girdle; represents the slate of suspension ;

— It is the the 60th radical of characters relating to cloth.

Note. The lower part of some ancient characters, v.g. L. 119, L. 92,
accidentally resembles . Note also that (L. 79 C) has nothing in common
with . But(L. 21 D) is derived from it, as are also the following characters

*Fu*^*4* *. *The cloth worn by the ancient Chinese, a kind
of skin apron hanging from the waist, down to the
knees. It was preserved as a souvenir of ancient

custom in the Imperial dress... represents the girdle, the piece of cloth,
the hanging of the same;

of which is analogous.

Note. The modern form is used for three characters that must be carefully
distinguished; shih^4 market, L. 34 D; fu^4 apron, L. 35 B; fei* vegetation,
L. 79 G, that forms the important phonetic series 45, whilst the two
preceding
ones have only a few derivatives.

Second series:liang^3 .
 (W35 : image d’une balance en équilibre)

Liang^3 . It represents scalse in equilibrium. This
character is now obsolete, but forms important
compounds in which its primitive meaning may be
still found. In these compounds, a supperadded ele-
ment develops the notion of weighing and equilibrium.
Thus two, represents the weight and counterpoise;
to enter-enter (L. 15), means that an equal
weight was placed on both sides; graphically
represents the same thing. Etc.

Sub-series: hsin^4 , which is often engraved by the modern writersop

Hsin^4 . The hairy head;

This was first a special primitive, representing
the hair raised up and knotted in a tuft; then the

forms often show the, split head of Buddhist pretas,
and always have an appendage, that was sometimes
taken for a tail, but that really represents the whirling
made by the ghost, while, it moves. — It forms the

*LESSON 43*

The eight following Lessons, 43 to 50, treat about the character
representing the
human hand. Among the modifications introduced in the modern writing, there
were none more deplorable, than the replacing of those very expressive
charac-
ters, by unrecognisable abbreviations.

In the old writing, the hand is represented in six different ways:



The right hand
prone. L. 49.

Both bands
raised. L. 47.

Both hands
hanging L. 50.


The right hand

in profile. L. 43 seq.

The left hand
in profile. L 46

The hand
facing. L 48.


A Note. The use of a compound, instead of the primitive, is frequent in
these
series, in order to make easier the distinction between the numerous
derivatives
from hand. See p. 16, aote 1.

*120 Etymological Lessons. 43.*

the stalk beheaded. To behead a man is now said
sha^1 , (L. 22 D) representing the sword's stroke.

Etymological Lessons. 46. 46. 127

Note that the modern scribes, leaving off the dot on the
top of , write etc., which gives the phonetic
6 strokes, instead of 7, and makes one mistake for

(L. 119). It is a licence. K'ang-hsi numbered 6 strokes in , 7 in , then
6 again in-, etc. It is an inconsistency.

*Fifth, series:*

*Ch'iu*^*2* *. *To search for, to ask, to implore. According
to the Glose, the primitive composition and meaning
of this character would be like those of (L. 44 E);

; to seize, or to hold by the tail

contracted (L. 100 B). The meaning, to beg, to pray, would come from
sacrifice of a bull for impetration, as under the Chow Dynasty. Perhaps,
in this
sacrifice, the offerer held by its tail the offered bull. — It seems
rather that the
primitive sense, was , to offer hairs (L 100) of the victim, with
prayers, as
was done in the ancient sacrifices. K'ang-hi wrongly classified under wa-
ter. — Phonetic series 263.

LESSON 46

A The first Series of this Lesson treats about the left hand . In the modern
writing, on the top of the compounds, it becomes ; af the bottom, it becomes

, etc. It is never written (See LL. 44 and 135 H).

The second Series treats about some compounds, in which the right hand
placed on the top, became also in the modern writing. In their ancient form,
those compounds are made just like those given in the LL. 43, 44, 45.

*First series: for*

Tso^3 . The left hand; Was soon
replaced by

Tso^3 . Properly, the help given by the left hand
to the right, its action;

128 Etymological Lessons. 46.

*Gh'a*_*4* *. *Variance, and consequently, aberration,
failure. Two hands opposite. While the left hand is
acting, offering some object, the right one does not
move, does not receive, remains hanging. Compare 43
P, 47 B, 47 Y, 50 A, etc.. The tracing of the hanging
right hand being too difficult with the modern writing-
brush, the composition of this character was modified
as follows; left hand, making two /with the
right one, /not agreeing with it, forsaken by the right
that (L 18 E) remains hanging, instead of helping
the left;

Finally, a foolish scribe wrote instead of , and
Li-ssu adopted. Conclusion : has nothing in com-
mon, either with , or with (/L, /103). — Phonetic
series 506.

To^4 . To build a (L. 86) line of contravallation,
terraces, to besiege, a fortified town, according to the
Chinese ways; represents the action of the besiegers;
/twice// //repealed, /means their great number; /left,

to the action of the besieged ; By extension,
to destroy. It forms

To^4 . Sui^2 Meat cut up.

One of the two was
replaced by the radical (L. 65).
It forms, contracted into in
the modern writing, the phonetic
series 480. The phonetic complex
sui^2 , to follow,

forms the phonetic
series 759.

*PI*^*4* *.** *Ordinary, vulgar. This meaning is chuan-chu from

the primitive meaning;

This character represents an ancient

drinking vase provided with a handle on the left side (a primitive
distinct from
(L. 152), and which was held with the left hand. How came this character
to mean
common, vulgar? There were, says the Glose, two wine vessels, the tsun^1 and
the pi^1 . The tsun^1 was used for the sacrifices, the pi^1 was used
every day. Later
on, the two characters were taken in the abstract sense for /noble//

In the modern writing, the hands are often mixed up with the object which
they hold. Among these compounds, that are now unrecognisable, some are very
important. The two following, J and K, are to be carefully distinguished.

Cheng^4 . Fire that can be handled, embers,
live coal, lit. grain of fire;

Compare , /L. /46 I. It forms

Gheng^4 . To caulk the seams

LESSON 54.

In the first part of this Lesson, a particular form of the primitive (L. 25)
will be studied. The second part is devoted to the primitives the
compounds of which resemble those of in the. modern writing.

*First part.*

*Pao*^*1* *.** *A man who bends to enfold an object;

To wrap up, to envelop,

to contain; a bundle, a whole. — It is the 20th radical
of characters relating to wrapping and enclosing.
Note that in a few modern characters, is written
like (14th radical); vg. (L. 167 C), (L. 69 G),
etc. The following compounds form important groups.

*Pao*^*1* *. *Actual meaning: to wrap up, to contain, in

strangely altered this character. Some specimens
of their skilfulness may be seen here:

Shao^2 A primitive representing a kind of spoon,
that was used to draw up; — (L. 1, 4°) represents
the contents; — Phonetic
series 27. It forms

Yu^3 . The full spoon., with an — index meaning that
it is being emptied (compare L. 1, 5°). To give (the
contents); This character became intricate
in course of time. The two hands of the receiver
were first added (L. 47). Then, on the top, the two
hands of the giver (L. 50). Under this last form,
makes the phonetic series 768, the radical being
added at the bottom. See L. 50 J.

LESSON 55

About three primitives ch'ing^1 , han_3 , pa^1 .
*First series**: *ch'ing^1 .

Ch'ing^1 . In ancient times the Emperoe, when
investing the feudatories or officials, handed over to
them one half ot a piece of wood or of jade diversely
cut out; the other half was used to make the proof, as
the modern counterfoil The two pieces gathered are
the ch'ing^1 . We shall see further (L 55 B, I)
and , the. two halves, left and right... When they
appeared before the Emperor, or when they held the
functions of their office, the feudatories or officials
had this kind of sceptre in their hands It was used
also as a seal. — It forms

Ch'ing^2 . This character first meant the feasts
(L. 26 M) of the. court, the high personages attending,
ranged in. two opposite rows. By extension, minis-
ters, high officials

Note: The modern form is not symmetrical, because the writing-brush
cannot trace, the left half against the grain. Note also that many
symmetrical
representations, absolutely different in the old writing, nowadays ressemble
ch'ing^1 . K'ang-hsi classified them under .These are nang^2 , L. 26 G;
mao^3 , L. 129 L); luan^3 , L. 108 D; yu^3 , L. 129 E.

dignity, authority, rule, just measure, print; part of
a whole, segment, fragment. — See L. 26 M; L. 64 D;
L. 47 V, W; L. 49 I. It is the 26tb radical.
Note the three different writings of the modern
form. The first must be distinguished from , a con-
tracted form of the 163th and 170th radicals — The second form is hardly
recogni-
sable from the cursive form of han^3 (L. 55 K); as well as from chi^s
(L. 84/),
/ i^3 (L. 85 B), ssu^4 (L. 85 A). K'ang-hsi did not succeed in
distinguishing
them; he counted sometimes two strokes, and at others three strokes. —
The third form is to be distinguished from pa^1 (L 55 L). — In all this
series,
it is quite impossible, without recurring to the old forms, to know
exactly which
element is used.

Fu^2 . The hand holding a sceptre; to impose
one's authority; It forms
fu^2 , to steer a boat (L. 66 C); and pao^4 , to
repress bandits (L. 102 G). But nan^3 is not derived
from ; see L. 43 ,J.

Chih^1 . A vessel that was u ed, in the feasts, for
pouring wine with measure;

The top that ressembles L. 30 A. is intended to

proper, for the sacrifices, for the table. The just
measure of flesh ;

She^4 . The blush of the human face, a mark

netic series 535.

The left half of (L. 55 A); It is
found in i^4 , that means, printing of the seal.

Second series: han^3 .

Han^3 . To bud, to put forth buds, to bloorn. A
primitive, representing the effort of the blooming, of
the springing up.

Note the modern form, identical with the second form
of (L. 55 B); hence confusions. — Phonetic series
6. Note the following compounds, in which there
remains something of the primitive idea of ,
external manifestation of an interior force, expansion,
eruption.

Fan^4 . To rush like adog. To invade, to offend.
Compare L. 37 B. In the symbolism of characters,
the dog plays a considerable, though not creditable
part.

*Han*^*2* *. *To withdraw the lolled tongue, and
hold it in the mouth. Compare L. 102 C. By
extension, to endure in silence. Note
the awful modern abbreviation, which became usual.—

(L. 58 C).

Third series: pa.

Pa^1 . A kind of boa, large and short, found in the
Southern Provincos, in Ssu-ch'uan and elsewhe-
re. Its flesh is eaten ( ), and its skin is used to
cover the guitars. The character represenls the boa raised on its tail;

chuan-chu meaning
of this important character, outside, out of.

Note: Like all the characters simple and easy to write, is used by the
scribes
as an arbitrary abbreviation for the most different elements. It
represents a bird
in (ancient form) L. 41 D; the antennae of an insect L. 23 G; the peduncle
ot a fruit L. 41 E; a rod L. 43 I). - Note also that has nothing in common

sometimes the phonetic, is introduced in this frame.
The general idea of this now obsolete character was,
a recipient, a case, a bag, placed high, out of reach. The

Second series: kao^1 .

Kao^1 . A kind of pavilion , raised upon a
substructure; represents the hall in this under
building; An elevated place;
high, lofty, eminent. — It forms the 189th radical.
Phonetic series 544. When it is variously contracted,

replaced by a pivot (L. 6 A); idea of loftiness, of
centrality. The capital or metropolis, centre of the
Empire. The
scribes altered the bottom in the modern character.
It is unconnected with — Phonetic series 336. It
forms

*Chiu*^*4* * *Admiration (L 134 C), before something

the group is gathered, one gets a mixture of yang, un, wu, uo, etc. This
phonetic confusion betrays a primitive diversity of characters which
cannot be
distinguished in the modern writing, but is manifest in the ancient forms.

Hsiang^3 . To offer a gift to a superior (
contracted); represents the object offered; it is a
modern primitive, distinct from yueh^1 L. 73, and
from jih^4 L. 143. —
The ancient form was composed of twoabbreviated,
one being straight, the other inverted; one offering,
the other receiving; Hence
two meanings; to /treat //with// //favour /(now heng^1 ),
or to /enjoy //the// favour received /(now hsiang^3 ).
Compare L 75 G. — Phonetic series 274 and 359; the
latter is almost completely attributed to the com-
pounds Ch'un^2 and huo^1 , below E, H.

Fu^2 . Abundance. According to some interpreters, this
character is composed of gifts received, and of
that divides in four parts , this division implying
that all the corners are filled;

— A more ancient explanation,
though less commonly admitted, seems to be the true
one. According to this, the character means
(contracted), the heaping up of the productions of the
fields, goods of the earth Abundance, prosperity,
Then the character is derived directly from , and
not from . — Note the modern deformation, and the
compounds fu^4 , bouses filled, wealth; fu^2 , a
transcendent influence that brings luck;

*Ch'un*^*2* *. *A lamb grown up, big and. nice enough
to be offered as a present:

*Shu*^*2* *. *To take /(L. 11/ E) a
lamb acceptable, to be
roasted; Note the
compound shu^2 , shon^2 , the lamb roasted ( L.
126); by extension, well cooked, ripe. — Phonetic

gative pronoun.

*Tun*^*1* *. *Meek-minded, honest,
simple as a lamb, that is
beaten and does not cry; to
bear, to beat, etc. — Phonetic series 715.

*Liang*^*2* * *The evolution of this character parallelled
the evolution of Chinese moral philosophy. Primitively
the gift (as in L. 75 D), the capital gift, the
nature heavenly received. In the second aucient cha-
racter, the coming down from heaven of the gift, is
shown graphically (school of Meng-tzu, good nature).
In the third ancient character, good and evil
(school of Tung chung-shu). Finally, the gift has been

lost (school of Li-ssu and Hsun-tzu, bad nature). —
Anyhow, the primitive meaning has been preserved:

, original qualities, nature, natural, inborn, good.
The actual character is an arbitrary contraction. See
L. 26 0. — Phonetic series 289. It forms

*Lang*^*2* *. *Name of an old city. Chia-chieh, a title. —
Phonetic series 460.

*Liang*^*2* *. *Measure, weight, to measure, to weigh.
Composed of (L. 120 K) weight, natural; the
weight of things according with their nature. Note the
contractions. It has nothing in common either with
L. 149 D, or with L. 143 B. It forms liang^2 ,
rations, food, provisions; the quantity of grains
required for food.

Hou^4 . Liberality, generosity. The reverse of ,

L 75 D. The inferior receives a gift ;

It is now written

Hou^4 . Liberality, generosity. The represents the

coming down of the gift, from upwards. By extension,

thick, large (qualities of a generous gift). The modern

character is an arbitrary abbreviation.

T'an^2 . Abundance of salt (L. 41 D); salting,
pickling; by extension, different macerations; various
chia-chieh. After many contractions, the bottom of the
character became . — Phonetic series 706.

with two (four) doors opposite, each surmounted with
a look-out. The is contracted. For the
modern abbreviation , see the note, L 75 D. —
Phonetic series 349. It forms

Kuo^1 . Walls ( city); it is
now used for the last character.
— Phonetic series 549.

Fu^4 This character is derived from kuo^1 (above,
the second ancient form, with a simple ), taken in
the sense of city, place. The turned up was
replaced by the radical (L. 31 B), to march, to go.
To go in a city, to market. By extension, to go where
one already often went, to return for a second time,
reiteration, repetitiou, etc.

Note. We incidently treat here about an important compound, li^3 , shoes,
to walk; it is seemingly derived from, but in reality, it has no connection
whatever with that character. Its story is thus given: primitively it was


Li^3 . The boats (L. 66), that men put their
feet in (L. 112). In fact, the ancient shoes of Chinese
much resembled a small boat;

Then (L. 63), to walk, was substituted for feet;
and a man (L. 32) for . Later on, the character
was increased with , to march (L. 3} C); this was
a mere redundancy. Lastly the scribes contracted
and into , the bottom of the character thus
becoming identical to fu^4 (L. 75 I).

Finally,


Chi^4 , clog. Chu^4 , shoe Hsueh^1 , boot Chiao^1 , shoe.


this compound became like a radical of shoes,
being replaced by different phonetics. For instance:



*Sixth** *series: k'o^1 , derived from

K'o^1 - To overcome, to prevail over, to repress, to
subdue, etc. The top part is contracted, that
means, pressure from upwards, a weight that hangs

heavily. Some say, the bottom is (L 65 F) shoulder, contracted. A load that

weighs heavy upon the shoulders;

The lower part seems rather to be a primitive, representing

the idea of bending under a load Note that, among the three compounds

k'o^1 , to be able of supporting, of mastering, the first is the right one,

though it is now used the least; To have the strength

of supporting, of subduing.

the Glose; why then is this ring marked at the
tail? More seemingly, the transversal piece fixed behind
the horns represents the yoke or the collar of the ox,
and the one trace passing under the animal is the
primitive harness; extremity curved to diminish the

and of no use, had its primitive meaning changed
into different arbitrary ones. It is now used specially to write the

has those
two meanings in very ancient texts. — Phonetic series 640.

Kou^4 .Some consider this characteras being composed
of two . one being straight, the other inverted,
while the stroke at the bottom was suppressed for
simplification's sake. This explanation seems to be far fetched. Kou^4
is a primitive,
whose straight and crossed lines represent graphically the timbers in
the frame-
work of a house, as they interlock and cross each other; hence the idea of a
net-work, an ordering, a combination. This notion is hinted in the
compounds,

centre by an arrow. Later on, the target was con-
tracted by the scribes and changed into a form some-
what like (L 72); but the primitive form is still
maintained in the series . To represent, in a design
without perspective, the perforation of the target, the
two extremities of the arrow were marked with a

Chinese
for the urine of the gecko (a lizard found in all the houses); also for
rain-water

because it explains belter the word vessel; poison of the worms taken with
food; —
Moreover, there are who say that the magicians make a poison slow and
sure, by
grinding in a vessel different sorts of venimous worms. This seems to be
rather a legend.

Min^2 .The people, the mass, the common multitude.
Some philologists consider this character as a mu^3

multiplication; people, the sons of women.

It is highly

probable that this interpretation is erroneous. Min^2 is
a primitive, a creeping plant with sprouts, that is
proliferous (second ancient character, ) The

OLD GRAPHIES.

Whensoever the ancient Chinese noblemen had been favoured by their princes,
or had experienced some kind of success or luck, they used to cast a
bronze vase,
in memoriam. Symbols and Characters relating the fact, were moulded on the
interior side of the vase, which was placed in the ancestral temple of
the family,
and served henceforth as a ritual vessel, when oblations and libations
were of-
fered to the Manes. 0» the /exterior /side of the vase, the two eyes of
the Ancestor,
were figured, looking at his sons and grandsons with benevolence. We are
indebted
to these old bronze vases, for all the old Graphies we possess. Ancient
Chinese
epigraphy on stone, is non-existent. Many fac-similes of vases and
inscriptions are
to be found in the 4th French edition of this work, /Caracteres Chinois,
/pages
361-452. In this English edition, the matter has been presented in a
summary way.

Now take good notice of one thing, which uses to baffle novices in Chinese
epigraphy. In all modern books, the engravers have replaced the /old//
//obsolete
//symbols /which are not characters, by /conuentional// current
characters /chosen
because of their form, without reference to their meaning. To translate
those signs,
would cause laughable blunders. For instance, instead of the symbol offering
of meat, they engrave the modern character father, because the old character

father resembled the symbol offering. — In the place of the poured
libation, they put a . — For the obsolete a distaff-load of textile
fibres pre-
sented to the Manes, they put a. And so on. — Remember this, when reading
the modern transcriptions of the following old Graphies, which have all been
photographed from rare Chinese epigraphic repertories, such as
etc.

362 Old Graphies. First part. Symbols.


The most frequent of all Symbols, is a right hand offering , which is
neither a flame, nor incense, but the smell of the offered meat,
ascending towards
the Ancestors.

Almost every time, beneath this symbol of offering meal, there is a sort of
tear, symbol of the poured down libation of wine. Instead of the falling
wine, they
sometimes figure the splash of the wine having fallen on naked soil.
This figure
is rare, because it was ritual custom to pour the libation on grass,
spread out or tied
into a bundle, which was burned after the ceremony was over. There are many
figures of this bundle of grass, sometimes graphically reduced to a , or
, or
anything else.

Old Graphies. First part. Symbols. 363



Ordinarily the son offering to his father (and an-
cestors) is represented in an ethereal shape,
which figures his being raptured and transported
mentally in the presence of his Ancestors, by his
filial love and desire to please them. Sometimes
arms and legs of the son are figured.

The grandsons able to stand upright, are figured
beneath the son (their father) holding up their
hands in prayer. — The grandsons too young to stand upright, crawl
between the
legs of their father, oftentimes resembling frogs. — Sometimes the
grandson is
figured like the son, but holding a skein of yarn, symbol of the
succession of
generations.

A added to the figure of a son or grandson, does not mean /two. /It is a
sign
of plurality meaning «All of them, as many as there are».

364 Old Graphies. First part. Symbols.


Sometimes the son does not offer the smell of the cooked meat, but the raw
meat cut in slices, which are exposed on the shelves of a dresser. A
libation of
wine is poured, as usual.

Besides the smell of meat and the libation of wine, three things are
presented at almost all solemn offerings. These are .

1 a box containing jade, cowries and pottery.

2 an amphora of wine, presented by two hands, with a ladle,

3 a distaff-load of textile fibres, with 2 or A hauds spinning.
The idea is very clear The Ancients offered to their deceased Ancestors, all
the things without which the living could not be; viz. valuables, money,
vases,
stuff for clothes, wine. Analyse the three figures above...

*Old Graphies. First part. Symbols. 365*

The cowries, current money of old China, are offered strung up, often In
great quantities, as much as a man can carry with a pole. — In some
texts, the
strings of cowries are figured in a compendious conventional form.




The offering of raw flesh is eventually figured by
the living animal, and the flint knife or the prehi-
storic axe indicative of the killing of it.

When the animal is not figured, the mere knife
in the hand of the son, denotes that he has killed an
animal to be offered.

366 Old Graphies. First part Symbols.

Sometimes the offering of raw meat is figured by the skinned hide of the
victim fastened on a stake, accompanied by libations, etc.

The presence of the Ancestor to whom the offering is made, is ordinarily
figured
by the heel of his foot; see Lesson 112 A. In modern Chinese, to say in
/presen-
//ce of, /is /before //the// heels of. //— /Now we are able to
interprete the
whole of the following two inscriptions... ( Left) In presence /of my
Ancestors, I
//offer /raw meat, a libation, wine and tow... (Right) In presence /of
my Ancestors,
/1 the son holding the flint knife, offer raw meat, libations, precious
things, wine
and tow.

*Old *Graphies. First part. Symbols. 367




Sometimes the offering is presented to a foot-
print, or to foot-prints of the deceased Ancestor.
Now-a-days, as of old, the Chinese try to discern the
foot-prints of the departed, on planks strewn over
with sand or ashes. See above four figures showing
the worship of foot-prints, In the first and second,
there is one; in the third, there are two of them.
In the fourth, the Ancestor has walked all around
the offering, sniffing its smell. In the fifth, the legs
of the Ancestor are visible. The frame which enclo-
ses three of these Graphies, will be explained on
page 368.

In some very rare cases, the Ancestor is figured standing, and the
offering is
presented to him directly. See above.

368 Old Graphies. First part. Symbols.


Sometimes the presence of the Ancestor is figured by his two eyes looking
with benevolence at the offerings. As has been said on page 361, the
benevolent
eyes of the Ancestor are figured on the outer side of all ancient
sacrificial vessels,
staring at the offerers. Sometimes the two eyes are replaced by one
triangle,
symbolising /sight /in abstracto.

The temple of the deceased Ancestor, or rather the sacred niche from whence
his transcendent influence is supposed to emanate, is figured by a
frame, square
or rectangular, often with inward curved angles.

*Old Graphies. *First part. Symbols. 369




Ordinarily the temple, and the presence of the
Ancestor in the temple, are figured, either by a
balustrade separating the nave from the sanctuary;
or by the inlet to the sanctuary, a narrow pass
between two or four pillars. All the supplicants,
sons and grandsons, are standing in front of this
entrance, the spot where the offerings are presen-
ted. — Hereby an excellent figure of the balustrade.
In the sanctuary, the eyes of the Ancestor stare at
the hide of the slahghtered victim, expanded on two
slakes. In front of the entrance, raw meat and liba-
tion, as usual.

370 Old Graphies. First part. Symbols.



Some times, in a fit of rapture, the offering son is spiritually
transported beyond
the balustrade and the pillars, into the sanctuary, unto the very
presence of the
Ancestor. See above, on the left, the best figure Antiquity has
bequeathed to us.
It dates from the 2d dynasty (circa B.C. 1500), and shows a raptured son
knee-
ling in presence of his standing father... In the two other figures, the
raptured son
carries cowries or meat (knife).


In some very rare but most precious figures, the
deceased Ancestor is represented /diving, /head,
foremost, from heavens above, towards the hand of
his offering son.

*Old Graphies. First part. Symbols. 371*



Sometimes the Ancestor is figured
by a ghostlike silhouette, with a single
eye, often surmounted by a triangle.
I call your attention to the second line
of the text reproduced beneath on the
right, in which you have firstly a fool-
print of the Ancestor, secondly his
ghostly shade.

Now we are able to understand all the Graphies on top of this page, and
others
on the following pages...

Presentation of a new-born child, To the sight of his Ancestor.

Presentation of a new-born b tbe. the fontanelle of whose skull is not yet-
closed, in the temple, with a libation

Presentation of twins, with offerings and libation.

Presentation to the Ancestor, is his temple, of a pair of twins, brother and
sister, with offerings.

In the presence of the Ancestor, after libation, offering of jade wine
and tow,
by the son, a grandson having recently been born.

Old Graphies. First part. Symbols. 373


Offering of a banner. In the. second figure, the
banner is offered, with a libation, to thank for the
apparition of a foot-print of the Ancestor, in the
temple.



Presentation of a new carriage... with offering of bleeding flesh on a
stake, in
the first figure., with the ordinary offerings, in the second figure.


Bunches of wheat are offered, to thank for the

Offering to the mountains... to the clouds. — Invitation to the dragon
to make
the clouds burst and rain pour down.

*Old Graphies. Second part. Texts. 375*

This bronze plate, dating probably from the 20th century B.C., is the oldest
specimen known of Chinese writing. It is not properly a text, but the
enumeration
of all kinds of animals killed in a great hunting. The document
reveals... 1 that
the shape of the primitive characters differed greatly from that of
their derivati-
ves... 2 that the principle of composition of characters, was always the
same, from
the beginning.

376 Old Graphies. Second part. Texts.



On the day i-ssu, in presence of the deceased grandfather, the widowed
grand mother (chief of the family) has offered, with wine etc., this
bronze tripod,
to last ten thousand years. Hoping that innumerable sons and grandsons will
enjoy it for ever.

In the eighth month, on the first
auspicious day which was *i-mao, *the
duke committed solemnly to the
standard-bearers the new standards.
This tripod was cast to commemorate
the fact, and was presented before the tablet of the Ancestor of the
clan, with the
usual offerings... sons and grandsons worshipping in front of the sanctuary.

*Old Graphies. Second part. Texts. *377




On the day keng-shen, the new emperor Wu-
ting went to the eastern gale of the city, to salute
the rising sun. On the evening of the same day, he
ordered minister Hu to deliver five man-loads of
cowries, to be presented with the ordinary offerings,
as a token of gratitude for the prints of feet and
hands of the deceased emperor Hsiao-i, which had
been noticed in the ancestral temple, five time»,
during the 16 months of mourning. This vase was
cast and placed in the sanctuary, to commemorate
the fact. — B.C. 1273.

378 Old Oraphies. Second part. Texts.


The emperor being
about to wage war
against the marquis of
Hsu, the duke of Chou
requested me Ch'in (the
official conjurer) to ana-
ematise the rebels. So
I Ch'in made with my
hand the comminatory
gestures, and pronoun-
ced with my mouth the
imprecatory words. The-
refore the emperor gave
me hundred ingots of
copper (of six ounces
each) as a reward. I
Ch'in have employed the
imperial gift, to make
this vase, which I pre-
sent to my Ancestors,
with the ordinary offe-
rings, in memoriam.

In the 9th month, the moon being full, on the day chia-hsu, the, emperor
having worshipped at the ancestral temple, sat down in the hall in which the
archives were kept. The Grand-Director Nan-chuang having introduced U-chuan
of Lu, the emperor ordered first the attendant registrar to lake his
tablets into his
hands, and then dictated his will, as follows: « U-chuan, I invest thee
with the
charge of inspector of Hu-fang. » — Having thus been honoured and
favoured by
the Son of Heaven, I, their grandson U-chuan, have cast this urn, to
gladden my
glorious Ancestors. I hope it will be the jewel of my descendants, for
ever. — 9th
century B.C.

380 Old Graphies. Second part. Texts.


During the .3th year of his reign (probably B C 768), in the 3th month, the
moon beginning to wane, on the day hsin-yn, the emperor staying at the new
palace in the capital, feasted Chu, the chief of the Literati. During
the banquet,
as he was in high spirits, the emperor proclaimed: «I give master Chu
ten strings
of cowries. • . Chu fell on his knees and thanked. — Having thus been
honoured
and rewarded by the Son of Heaven. I Chu offer this anaphora with a
basin, to the
flrst Ancestor of ray race, and place them in the ancestral temple, to
be the heredi-
tary treasure of my descendants.

This is a fragment of a long document contemporary with Confucius, which I
quote to show the shape of the characters in which the Confucian
Canonies were
first written. After having witnessed those clumsy figures, I suppose
you will be
rather lenient with the blunders committed by their interprelers. [See
4th French
edition, pages 442-449.]
