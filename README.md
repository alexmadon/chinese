*CHINESE CHARACTERS - Their origin, etymology, history, classification and signification* by Dr. L. Wieger, S.J. was first published in 1899 (French) and 1915 (English). It has eversince been republished. It does not include the 20th century discoveries and therefore is technically wrong in many respects. However, based on the 2nd century *Shuowen Jiezi*, it reflects the Chinese tradition and culture. It is what many Chinese know about their writing.

Some scanned copies of the book can be found on the internet, but the Chinese charactes are rarely represented in UTF-8 (OCR is difficult on the ancient forms).

In the project I tried to identify them and type them, which is a fun way to learn.

After I started this project I found

where a lot of work has been done (in particulat they have a list of characters per lesson)
